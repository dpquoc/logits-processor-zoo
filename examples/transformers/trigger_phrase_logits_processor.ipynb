      "   \n",
      "2. **Recursive Case**:\n",
      "   - For any `n` greater than 1, the nth Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers. This is achieved by recursively calling the function with `n-1` and `n-2` and adding their results.\n",

      "- **Recursive Case**: For any `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2`, and returns the sum of these two recursive calls. This builds up the solution by solving smaller subproblems and combining their results.\n",
